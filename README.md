A chromeApp I'm building for myself. It lets you save snippets of code and sync it with your google account. That way you can access your snippets on any device capable of running the app. (Mobile devices a possibility in the future.) Also has a handy little notepad :)

Check out the early prototype at [CodePen.io](http://codepen.io/Deftwun/pen/wKKZLX)

Or see the latest version on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-saver/agbpecgkfhpjgojccoibggaaaajkeglg)
